# Drowsy-driver-detection-system-using-deep-learning.
The project aims to develop a Drowsy Driver Detection System using deep learning techniques. It will involve collecting and annotating a diverse dataset of driver behavior and facial cues. The deep learning model will be trained to detect signs of drowsiness such as eyelid drooping, head nodding, and yawning.
